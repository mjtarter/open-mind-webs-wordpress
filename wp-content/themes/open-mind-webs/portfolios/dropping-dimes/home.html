            <div class="title-box-1">Let's Drop Some Dimes</div>
        	<p id="mission-text">The phrase "dropping a dime" is well known to those who have lived and breathed basketball at some point in their lives. Players who love the "set up", who live to make a no-look pass to a teammate for a thunderous dunk, or who care more about taking care of their teammates than themselves, have been dropping dimes on blacktops and hardwood courts for years. This has been a popular basketball term for generations now and, of course, refers to a great pass and a scoring “assist” to a teammate. The phrase may have actually originated during the Great Depression of the 1930's, when John D. Rockefeller started literally "dropping" dimes to assist children and others in need on the streets. By appearing to drop the dimes (which were worth something then), Rockefeller may have been trying to provide a small amount of immediate relief while also preserving a measure of dignity. Rockefeller was known as a great philanthropist, and in addition to his many other charitable pursuits, it is said that he “dropped” around $40,000 in dimes throughout his life, an enormous amount of money during that period of time. Let's keep the tradition of the greatest point guards and philanthropists alive by assisting some of the great men who played their hearts out for their cities and teams in the original ABA.</p>
			<p id="mission-mobile-text">The mission of the Dropping Dimes Foundation is simple: To raise public awareness of, and to provide financial and other types of support for, former professional basketball players who played in, and contributed to the economic growth and development of, cities, states and communities that hosted teams from the former American Basketball Association, but who are currently living in economically or medically disadvantaged situations.

            <p id="hardships-text">Lloyd "Sonny" Dove was a 6'8 forward who was the 4th overall pick in the 1967 NBA draft and played 3 seasons in the ABA for the New York Nets, averaging 11 points and 6 rebounds per game during his professional career. Dove's basketball career was cut short by injuries and off-court issues. Pro players were not paid nearly as well as today’s athletes, and his shortened career left Sonny without a means to earn a livelihood. <span id="hardships-more-text">He returned to college to complete his degree and began a broadcasting career. He had big dreams, applying to the FCC for a license to purchase a radio station in Florida with a group of investors. While waiting for that approval, however, he was also supporting himself and his daughter by working a second job as a cab driver. One night, while driving his cab, he failed to see a flagman stopping traffic. His car skidded off the road and plunged 25 feet into the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, causing his death at the young age of 37.</span><span id="hardships-small-button"><a href="sonny-dove-story.html">Full Story</a></span><span id="hardships-large-button"><a href="stories.html" class="button2 button-red">View More Stories</a></span></p>

            <p id="did-you-know-text">Bob Netolicky became one of the few professional basketball players in history to play for both teams in a single game, when he played for the San Antonio Spurs and the Indiana Pacers. Netolicky was playing for the Spurs on November 14, 1973 when they lost to the Pacers on a shot at the buzzer. However, the Spurs protested the loss, and won the appeal.<span id="hardships-more-text">The remaining 30 seconds of the game were to be replayed at a later date. By the time this date arrived however, Netolicky had been traded to the Pacers. He played in the final 30 seconds as well as in the ensuing overtime period. However, this time the Spurs were able to come out victorious. Of course, that also makes Neto one of the very few pro basketball players to have lost with two different teams in the same game!
